# WDTF Web App!

This is the app for the Water Data Webapp launched by BIM4Water! This project is designed to visualise the water sector's data sharing initiatives and to promote visbility of such projects across our industry.
The page uses D3js and Bootstrap to visualise the data. It is heavily inspired from the clustered force layout by M.Bostock which can be found here (https://d3og.com/mbostock/1747543/)
**Get involved!** If you want to contribute or help us to develop the page or the data collection, get in touch with BIM4Water via LinkedIn now!

#### What still needs doing (As at Nov 2024)

Migrate D3js code to separate js file outside HTML.
Add links to the project website in graph.
Review Json data processing.
Data cleansing and processing needed from survey results.


**More to come, i'm sure!**

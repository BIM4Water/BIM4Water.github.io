 ","The Climate Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) is a pioneering climate change adaptation digital twin project that provides a practical example of how connected data can improve climate adaptation and resilience across a system of systems.

CReDo’s core connected digital twin technology integrates data describing extreme weather events for different climate projections with data and models describing the interdependence of infrastructure networks. Our technology combines data from energy, water and telecoms networks with climate data to understand interdependent and cascading risks, asset failure and system-wide impacts.  

A major challenge to understanding the impact of extreme weather scenarios across infrastructure networks is the lack of comprehensive risk assessment considering cascading risks across the whole infrastructure system. This has led to inadequate planning and preparedness at the organisational, regional and national level in the face of climate change. While historical asset failure data can aid in understanding these risks, it alone does not solve the problem. This gap has resulted in unforeseen negative impacts on communities and businesses. 

We have addressed data gap through the process of expert elicitation, a methodology which involves extracting operational knowledge from expert engineers to build probabilistic failure models that consider various climate scenarios based on climate data projections.  

The knowledge is digitised and translated into a format which is usable by CReDo technologies, including the CReDo digital twin and the CReDo?Asset Risk Tool.? The digitised knowledge can then be used by these applications to provide insights on the probability of asset failure in an extreme weather.
